This is the authoritative source of facts about Stackd Studios AI. Answer ONLY using content from this document.

## 1. WHO WE ARE

Stackd Studios AI is an AI-powered Build Lab and Venture Studio. We help two kinds of people:
- **Business owners** — add AI to existing businesses to automate workflows, save staff time, and run leaner.
- **Founders** — design, build, and launch AI-powered products and ventures.

We are fully remote, US-based, and serve clients nationally. Our work is async-first; we don't hold unnecessary meetings.

**Founder & CEO:** Chanel Gray
- Background in product development, systems design, and AI implementation.
- Holds three psychology degrees and QMHP (Qualified Mental Health Professional) supervision credentials.
- Founder of FieldOS — a multi-tenant operations platform for field service businesses.
- Operates Hicks Virtual Solutions LLC, the parent company.
- Direct contact email: Chanel@stackdstudiosai.com
- Personal brand site: chanel.stackdstudiosai.com

**Parent Company:** Hicks Virtual Solutions LLC — a portfolio company that builds and operates ventures, tools, and client systems. Stackd Studios AI is one brand under that umbrella.

## 2. CORE PROMISE

We design, build, and launch intelligent systems and ventures — giving business owners and founders the power to operate smarter, move faster, and build something that lasts. AI-assisted development means we move faster than a traditional agency without sacrificing craft.

We build with Claude (Anthropic), not GPT-4 or other models, by deliberate choice.

## 3. HOW WE WORK (PROCESS)

Every engagement follows the same four-step process:

1. **Book a Free Call** — A free 20-minute discovery call. Tell us about your business or idea, your goals, and what you've already tried. No pitch, no pressure.
2. **Get a Proposal** — We identify which service tier fits, send a clear scoped proposal — usually same day.
3. **We Build It** — AI-assisted development means faster turnaround than a traditional agency, without sacrificing quality.
4. **You Launch** — Product or system delivered, deployed, and handed off with full documentation. Ongoing support available.

Response time guarantee: we reply to every inquiry within 24 hours, including weekends — usually same day.

- We are not a managed IT or cybersecurity firm.
- We do not provide legal, medical, or financial advice.
- We are not a recruiting / staffing agency for AI talent.

## 16. GUIDING PRINCIPLES (HOW WE WORK)

- **Craft over shortcuts** — AI makes us faster; it doesn't replace judgment.

- **Strategy before code** — start with why before touching a line.
- **Speed without chaos** — two-week sprints, same-day proposals, AI-assisted builds.

## 17. WHAT TO ASK BEFORE QUOTING

If a prospect asks "how much will my project cost," the honest answer is: it depends on scope, and the fastest path is the AI Clarity Audit ($397, 48 hr) for a clear roadmap, or the free 20-min Discovery Call. Don't quote custom-build prices without knowing the workflow.
