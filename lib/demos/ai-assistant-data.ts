So we built it.

Today I'm announcing **AI Quick Setup** — one specific workflow built, tested, and handed off in 5 business days. No 6-month engagement. No "AI strategy deck." Just the one piece of your business that's eating your week, automated, with a custom prompt library so your team can actually use it.

Pick a workflow. We build it. You're using it Monday.

If something specific just came to mind, comment "interested" and I'll DM you the details.`,

3. "Your competitor isn't smarter than you. They just have better prompts."
4. "If you've tried AI and given up, you're 90% of the way there. You just stopped at the wrong step."
5. "Why I tell every business owner: don't subscribe to another AI tool until you've done this."

My pick: **#1 or #4** — they hint at a specific fix, which gets people to keep watching for the answer.`,

Hey {first_name},

Quick story before the meaty stuff this week.

A residential services client came to us a month ago with a 3-hour-a-day intake problem. Every morning, the owner sat down to manually parse 15-30 customer messages and route them to the right tech. He was burning 60% of his "founder hours" on what should've been a 20-minute task.

We built him a Smart Intake system in 6 days. Drop the message in, AI parses it into structured fields, routes to the right tech via SMS. Owner reviews and approves in under 15 minutes a day.

He texted me yesterday: "Got my mornings back."

That's the kind of win we live for. Three things below to help you find your version of it ↓`,

Hey {first_name} —

Wanted to circle back on the conversation we had a couple weeks ago about [their workflow/problem]. Totally get if it's slipped down the priority list — I know how that goes.

Two quick things in case it helps:

1. **No rush on my end.** If now's not the moment, just say so and I'll check back in a quarter (or whenever you tell me to).
2. **One thing I forgot to mention** that came up after we spoke: [insert relevant case study, resource, or small insight you've learned since].

Either way, would love to know where things landed. Even a one-line "we picked X" or "we paused" helps me close the loop.

    response: `**Subject:** Totally get it — small thought before you go

Hey {first_name} —

Appreciate you being upfront — that's actually rare and I'm grateful for it.

Two thoughts before you make a final call:

1. If the **scope** is what's pushing it over budget, we could carve out a smaller starting piece (e.g. one workflow instead of three) for ~30% of the original. Sometimes that's the right call; sometimes it isn't. Happy to scope it if useful.
2. If it's just **not the right time** at all, that's also totally fine. I'll add you to my "check back in 2 quarters" list and circle back then. No drip sequence, no nurture funnel — just a real human ping when the timing might've shifted.

Either way, you have my email. If anything changes, you know where to find me.

Hey {first_name} —

Pumped to officially have you on board. The kickoff materials are coming Wednesday.

One small ask while you're feeling the most enthusiastic you'll ever feel about this engagement (which is right now, statistically): **who else in your world might benefit from what we're about to build for you?**

Two specific kinds of people I'm asking about:

1. Someone in a similar role at a different company who's drowning in [the specific problem we're solving for you]
2. A peer of yours who you respect and who'd take a recommendation from you seriously

If 1-2 names come to mind, just hit reply with their first names. I'll handle the intro language and CC you so it never feels like cold outreach. If nobody comes to mind, no worries at all — we'll do great work together regardless.

Thanks again for the trust. More soon.

**Day 0 (within 1 hour of signed contract):**
- Send welcome email (template ready in Hubspot)
- Add to CRM with stage = "Onboarding"
- Trigger Notion workspace clone for the new client
- Calendar invite for kickoff call (Day 7)

**Day 1:**
- Send intake form (Tally) — covers goals, current tools, decision-makers, success metrics
- Add client primary contact + billing contact to Slack Connect channel
- Internal: assign Project Lead and Account Manager

**Days 2–4 (gated on intake form completion):**
- Project Lead reviews intake responses, drafts engagement plan in shared Notion doc
- Send doc to client for async review with 3 specific yes/no questions
- AM follows up 48 hr later if no response

**Day 5:**
- Client approves engagement plan (or requests changes — re-cycle once)
- Internal: lock scope, assign timeline milestones, create Linear project

**Day 6:**
- Send kickoff agenda 24 hr before call
- Confirm attendance with both sides

**Day 7 — Kickoff call (45 min):**
- Walk through engagement plan → confirm out loud
- Walk through Notion workspace → make sure they can find everything
- Set the next 3 milestones with dates
- End with "what would make you a 10/10 raving fan" question

**Async pre-work (due Friday EOD):**
Each person posts in #team-async:
- ✅ One thing I shipped this week
- 🚧 One thing I'm stuck on (or close to stuck on)
- 🎯 My one priority next week

**Live agenda (25 min total):**

⏱ **0:00–3:00 — Quick wins round-robin**
Each person reads their ✅ aloud (60 seconds max). No questions yet.

⏱ **3:00–13:00 — Unblock**
Each 🚧 gets ~2 min: person names what they need (decision, intro, second pair of eyes, coverage). Group either solves on the spot OR assigns an owner to follow up offline. Time-box hard.

⏱ **13:00–20:00 — Single shared focus**
Pick the ONE thing that's most load-bearing for the whole team this week. Discuss what would unblock it. Capture the next action + owner in the meeting doc.

⏱ **20:00–24:00 — Heads-ups**
PTO, client calls others should know about, anything timezone-y. Quick, no debate.

⏱ **24:00–25:00 — Close**
Recap the 1-2 follow-ups assigned and who's on the hook. End on time.

**Rules of the road:**
- No status updates in the meeting (those go in async pre-work).
- If a topic exceeds its time, it gets a follow-up DM, not extra airtime.
- Cancel the meeting if no one has a 🚧 worth discussing — async-first means we don't meet to feel productive.`,

    fullPrompt: "Draft a 1-page framework for evaluating vendors (software or services) before signing a contract.",
    response: `**Vendor Evaluation Framework** — score 1–5 on each dimension; vendor needs ≥ 3.5 average to proceed.

**1. Fit (does it actually solve our problem?)**
- Does it solve the *exact* problem, or are we forcing a fit?
- Will the team adopt it, or will it sit unused after week 2?

**2. Cost (total, not sticker)**
- Annual list price + setup fees + integration cost + training time
- What does it cost us to switch off later? (Lock-in risk)

**3. Maturity**
- How long has the vendor been around? Funded vs profitable?
- Who else uses them at our scale? Can we talk to a reference?

**4. Support**
- SLA on response time
- Named human contact, or ticket queue?
- Documentation quality (skim it — is it embarrassing?)

**5. Reversibility**
- Can we export our data in a usable format?
- 30/60/90-day exit clause?

**6. Security & Compliance** (only if relevant)
- SOC 2 / HIPAA / etc. — current, not "in progress"
- Where's the data hosted?
- Who at the vendor has access to our production data?

**Process:**
- 2 stakeholders score independently → average → if averages diverge by > 1 point, talk before deciding
- Always demo with REAL data from our business, not vendor's sandbox
- Pilot with a 30-day exit clause before any annual commit

**Red flags that override the score:** opaque pricing, sales pressure, can't get a reference, won't sign a DPA, demos use only the prettiest features, founder ghosted you in a thread.`,

**1. The skeptic angle** — *"I tried AI for my business for 30 days. Here's what actually moved the needle (and what was hype)."*
→ Best for owners who've heard the buzz but feel burned by it.

**2. The how-to angle** — *"5 things to automate this month that pay for themselves in 2 weeks"*
→ Strong evergreen SEO play. Specific = clickable.

**3. The contrarian angle** — *"Don't subscribe to another AI tool. Do this instead."*
→ Pattern-breaks. Good for an audience drowning in tool overwhelm.

**4. The case study angle** — *"How a 3-person plumbing company replaced 12 hours of admin work a week with one Claude prompt"*
→ Concrete = credible. Most-shared format if you have the case to back it up.

**5. The "behind the curtain" angle** — *"The exact prompt I use to write client emails (you can steal it)"*
→ Generosity = trust. Pair with a one-page PDF download to capture leads.

**My pick to write first: #4.** It builds the most credibility per minute of reader time. Use #5 as a follow-up once you have a list to send it to.`,
